Using TypeScript and Office 365 Enterprise Services in Angular Applications
===========================================================================

Abstract
--------
> In this session you will see how to build a single page application using the Angular and TypeScript frameworks. You'll see how to leverage the ADAL JS framework to call the Office 365 APIs using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). The session will explain the benefits of using Typescript strongly typing alongside the Office 365 APIs and the Angular framework. An end to end solution will be used, called the Expense Manager framework, which leverages the OneDrive for Business, Sites and Mail/Calendar/Contacts API.
